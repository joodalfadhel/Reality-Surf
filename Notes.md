## Main


## Game Panel 

**doublebuffered**: if set to true, all the drawings from this componenet would be one in an offscreen painting buffer



How do 2D games work?

**Existence of Time**
Once you start the program the program keeps running 

If game is fps 60 -> updates screen 60 times (60 static images)

When an object implementing interface Runnable is used to create a thread, starting the thread causes the object's run method to be called in that separately executing thread.

----
**game loop**: show that the game is running 
update -> repaint -> update -> repaint ....


**Graphics**: a class that has many functions to draw objects on the screen

This Graphics2D class extends the Graphics class to provide more sophisticated control over geometry, coordinate transformations, color management, and text layout.

**Player Positions**:
in java, upper left corner is x:0 y:0 
x value increases to the right -> 
y value increases down

## Key Handler

VK -> Virtual Key: reports which key was selected
